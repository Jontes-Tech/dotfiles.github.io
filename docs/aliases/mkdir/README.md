# Mkdir aliases

The `mkdir.aliases.sh` file creates helpful shortcut aliases for creating
directories.

the `mkdir` command line tool. Mkdir is a tool which creates a directory.

## Mkdir

[Mkdir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mkdir) is a command that creates a
directory. The mkdir utility creates the directories named as operands, in the
order specified, using mode “rwxrwxrwx” (0777).
