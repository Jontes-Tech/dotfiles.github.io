# Chmod aliases

The `chmod.aliases.sh` file creates helpful shortcut aliases for changing
file permissions.

## Permission

The chmod utility modifies the file mode bits of the listed files as specified
by the mode operand. It may also be used to modify the Access Control Lists
(ACLs) associated with the listed files.
