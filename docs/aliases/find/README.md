# Find aliases

The `find.aliases.sh` file creates helpful shortcut aliases for the `fd` command
. The `fd` command is a cross-platform alternative to `find`.

Traditionally, the `find` command is used to search for files in a directory
hierarchy and perform actions on the files that are found.

We decided to substitute the `find` command with the `fd` command which is
simpler, fast and user-friendly alternative to `find`.

## Find

[fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) is a simple, fast and user-friendly
alternative to `find`. While it does not aim to support all of find's powerful
functionality, it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for a majority of
use cases.

| Alias | Command | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| fd | `fd --color always` | always colorize output by default. |
| fda | `fd --absolute-path` | list all files with absolute path. |
| fdc | `fd --ignore-case` | list all files with case insensitive search. |
| fdd | `fd  --list-details` | list all files with details. |
| fde | `fd --extension` | list all files with extension. |
| fdf | `fd --follow` | list all files with follow symlinks. |
| fdh | `fd --help` | list all files with help. |
| fdh | `fd --hidden` | list all files with hidden files. |
| fdn | `fd --glob` | list all files with glob. |
| fdo | `fd --owner` | list all files with owner. |
| fds | `fd --size` | list all files with size. |
| fdu | `fd --exclude` | list all files with exclude. |
| fdv | `fd --version` | list all files with version. |
| fdx | `fd --exec` | Execute a command for each search result. |
| find | `fd` |  fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find. |
