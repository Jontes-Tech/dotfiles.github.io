# GNU Core Utilities Aliases

The `gnucoreutils-aliases.sh` file creates helpful shortcut aliases for many
commonly used [GNU coreutils][coreutils] commands.

The GNU Core Utilities aliases, provide powerful commands that create shortcuts
to frequently used Core utilities commands. All of these functions and aliases
are wrappers around the GNU Core Utilities which are the basic, fundamental
tools of a GNU/Linux system.

These are the core utilities which are expected to exist on every operating
system.
