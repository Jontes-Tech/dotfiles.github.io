## üèó Make

[Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)) is a tool which controls
the generation of executables and other non-source files of a program from the
program's source files. Make gets its knowledge of how to build your program
from a file called the `Makefile`, which lists each of the non-source files and
how to compute it from other files.
