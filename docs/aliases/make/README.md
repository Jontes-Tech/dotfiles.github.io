# Make aliases

The `make.aliases.sh` file creates helpful shortcut aliases for running `make`
commands.

## Make

[Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)) is a tool which controls
the generation of executables and other non-source files of a program from the
program's source files.

Make gets its knowledge of how to build your program from a file called the
`Makefile`, which lists each of the non-source files and how to compute it from
other files.
