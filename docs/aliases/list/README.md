# List aliases

The `list.aliases.sh` file creates helpful shortcut aliases for listing files
and directories.

For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory, `ls` displays
its name as well as any requested, associated information.  For each operand
that names a file of type directory, `ls` displays the names of files contained
within that directory, as well as any requested, associated information.
