# Disk usage aliases

The `du.aliases.sh` file creates helpful shortcut aliases for the `du` command.

The Disk usage aliases, are designed to display disk usage statistics. They are
used to calculate and print the disk space used by files or directories.

## Disk usage

[Disk usage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du_(Unix)) is a command that
estimates file space usage. The `du` command is used to estimate file space
usage. The space used by each file is shown in kilobytes. The space used by each
directory is shown in kilobytes, along with the total space used by all files in
that directory and its subdirectories.

| du    | `du -h` | Show the disk usage of the current directory. |
| du1   | `du -hxd 1 | sort -h` | File size of files and directories in current directory. |
| ducks | `du -cks *.*| sort -rn | head -n 10` | Top 10 largest files and directories in current directory. |
| duh   | `du` | File size of files and directories. |
